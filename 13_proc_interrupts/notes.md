Column 1:  IRQ number
            the file shows only interrupts corresponding to installed handlers

Column 2:  counter of the number of interrupts received.
           A column is present for each processor on the system

Column 3/4: Type of the interrupt and device that handles the interrupt.
            For x86.
            XT-PIC â€” This is the old AT computer interrupts. 8259
            IO-APIC 

Column 5:  device associated with this interrupt
            This name is supplied by the devname parameter to request_irq(),
            


Difference between  IO-APIC-fasteoi and IO-APIC-edge?
----------------------------------------------------

The difference lies in the way the interrupts are triggered.

The -edge interrupt are edge triggered.
The -fasteoi interrupts are level interrupts that are triggered until the interrupt event is acknowledged in the programmable interrupt controller (PIC). 
The EOI stands for End Of Interrupt.
